# College Basketball Stats

&nbsp;

<div style="text-align:justify;"> Matchup tool for NCAA Division 1 Men's Basketball teams.  This app predicts the score outcome of games and gives the probability a team will win.  The app itself, <a href = "https://dschof1.shinyapps.io/cbb_stats/">College Basketball Matchup Predictor</a>, is hosted on https://shinyapps.io. </div>

&nbsp;

<div style="text-align:justify;"> There is also an Excel file included here that contains links to the team logos of all 347 Division 1 teams playing this year (2020/2021 season).  I will attempt to keep this file updated every year especially since conferences like the Ivy League for example are not playing this year due to COVID. </div>

&nbsp;

<div style="text-align:justify;"> I plan on continuing to add interactive content and the rationale behind it, espeially as we progress towards the Conference Tournaments and March Madness.  More specific information can be found at the bottom of the Methodology section in the <a href="https://dschof1.shinyapps.io/cbb_stats/">College Basketball Matchup Predictor</a>. </div>
