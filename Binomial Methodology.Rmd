<h4>Traditional Predictive Models</h4>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> Typically, predictive models in college basketball are viewed as “what are the chances Team A beats Team B?” This chance a team has to beat another team is predicated on the <a href="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/399/handouts/Log5WonLoss_Paper.pdf">Log5</a> first developed in 1981 by Bill James, creator of the famous <a hfref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics">sabermetrics</a> from baseball. This methodology makes use of another of Bill James’ creations, the <a hfref="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/399/handouts/PythagWonLoss_Paper.pdf">Pythagorean Expectation Formula</a>. While I won’t go into the vast amounts of detail in this procedure the major drawback is that it is an empirical approach, it has been tweaked to find what works best given previous results. While this has been shown to work I wondered if there could be a more traditional probabilistic approach to the posed question.  </div>

&nbsp;

<h4> A New Method </h4>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> Just before the March Madness tournament in the spring of 2021 I had an epiphany about the game of basketball that will sound rather trivial at first. Each time a team has the ball there are only two possible outcomes, they either score or don’t score. This is classically modelled by a binomial distribution as there are only two outcomes with probability of success \\(p\\) and probability of failure \\(1-p\\). In order to model this we need to know what the probability of success per trip is for a given team. Thankfully this is a metric that is actually tracked and rather easy to compute. Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG %) is a measure of how successful a team is from the field. It is better than traditional FG % because it incorporates both 2-point FGs and 3-point FGs and adjusts for the extra point for a 3-point basket. It is calculated using the following formula: </div>

&nbsp;

<div align="center"> $$\text{eFG %} = \frac{\text{FG} + (0.5 \cdot \text{3P})}{\text{FGA}}$$</div>

where:

<ul>
  <li>\\(\text{FG} =\\) Field Goals Made</li>
  <li>\\(\text{3P} =\\) 3-Pointers Made</li>
  <li>\\(\text{FGA} =\\) Field Goals Attempted</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> Most critically this equation is free from tempo. It is independent of how many possessions a team has per game. However it doesn’t account for how good an opposing team’s defence is. Later this will be taken into account.  </div>

&nbsp;

<h4> Expected Field Goals Attempted </h4>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> The next logical question to ask is how many shot attempts will a team have in a game? We know that inherently the number of shots taken is proportional to the number of possessions they might have in a game. Thus the expected FGA for team A can be calculated by: </div>

&nbsp;

<div align="center"> $$E(\text{FGA}_{A})=\text{FGA}_{A} \cdot \frac{E(\text{Tempo}_{A,B})}{\text{AdjTempo}_{A}}$$</div>

where:

<ul>
  <li>\\(\text{FGA}_{A} =\\) Average Field Goals Attempted by team A per game</li>
  <li>\\(E(\text{Tempo}_{AB}) =\\) Expected Tempo of a game played between team A and team B</li>
  <li>\\(\text{AdjTempo}_A =\\) Adjusted Tempo of team A</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<h4> Expected Tempo </h4>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> This is clearly not independent of tempo, and inherently that makes sense. The faster two teams play the more possessions each of them should have, and therefore the more shot attempts they should have. This equation, however, is predicated on tempo, which we have not yet calculated. Tempo is a metric that indicates how fast a team plays. Simply put, adjusted Tempo is a measurement of how many possessions a team would have against the average Division 1 team. I won’t get into the specifics of how possessions and tempo are calculated due to their vast complexity, but more info about <a hfref="https://web.archive.org/web/20210301005424/https://cbbstatshelp.com/efficiency/possessions/">possessions</a> and <a hfref="https://web.archive.org/web/20210301004521/https://cbbstatshelp.com/efficiency/tempo-and-pace/">tempo</a> can be found at <a hfref="https://web.archive.org/web/20210301001256/https://cbbstatshelp.com/">College Basketball Stats Help</a>. In order to calculate game score we must first find the expected tempo team A and team B will have compared to the Division 1 average when they play each other. This is calculated by the following:  </div>

&nbsp;

<div align="center"> $$E(\text{Tempo}_{A,B}) = \frac{\text{AdjT}_A}{\text{AdjT}_{\text{NCAA}}} \cdot \frac{\text{AdjT}_B}{\text{AdjT}_{\text{NCAA}}} \cdot \text{AdjT}_{\text{NCAA}}$$ </div>

where:

<ul>
  <li>\\(E(\text{Tempo}_{A,B}) =\\) The expected number of possessions that team and A and B will each have</li>
  <li>\\(E(\text{AdjT}_{A}) =\\) The adjusted number of possessions team A has in a game</li>
  <li>\\(E(\text{AdjT}_{B}) =\\) The adjusted number of possessions team B has in a game</li>
  <li>\\(\text{AdjT}_{NCAA} =\\) The adjusted number of possessions the average NCAA Division 1 team has in a game</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<h4> Expected Possessions </h4>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> One interesting implication of this equation is that when two teams who have higher than average possessions per game play each other their expected possessions per game are higher than either of their individual possessions per game. As we adjusted the tempo stat for team A when they play team B we similarly need to adjust the expected eFG % of team A given that they are playing against the defence of team B. This is done using thing following equation: </div>

&nbsp;

<div align="center"> $$E\text{(eFGO)}_{A} = \frac{\text{eFGO}_{A}}{\text{eFGO}_{\text{NCAA}}} \cdot \frac{\text{eFGD}_B}{\text{eFGD}_{\text{NCAA}}} \cdot \text{eFGO}_A \cdot \frac{1}{100}$$ </div>

where:

<ul>
  <li>\\(E(\text{eFGO)}_{A} =\\) The expected eFG % of team A against team B</li>
  <li>\\(\text{eFGO}_A =\\) The eFG % of team A</li>
  <li>\\(\text{eFGO}_{NCAA} =\\) The NCAA average eFG %</li>
  <li>\\(\text{eFGD}_{B} =\\) The eFG % that team B’s defence keeps opposing offences to</li>
  <li>\\(\text{eFGD}_{NCAA} =\\) The NCAA average eFG % that defences keep opposing offences to</li>
  <li> Note that raw data comes in percentage form, which is divided by 100 to convert it to decimal form </li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<h4> Offensive and Defensive Efficiency </h4>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> Offensive and defensive efficiencies are important in calculating the expected number of points a team will score. Each of these metrics is calculated on a per-game basis and then averaged to get overall values. The per-game values are calculated using the following formulas: </div>

&nbsp;

 <div align="center"> $$\text{OE}_{GA} = \frac{\text{PPP}_O}{\frac{\text{OAdjDE}}{\text{PPP}_{\text{NCAA}}}} ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \text{DE}_{GA} = \frac{\text{PPP}_D}{\frac{\text{OAdjOE}}{\text{PPP}_{\text{NCAA}}}}$$</div>
 
 where:
 
<ul>
  <li>\\(\text{OE}_{GA} =\\) Game Adjusted Offensive Efficiency</li>
  <li>\\(\text{DE}_{GA} =\\) Game Adjusted Defensive Efficiency</li>
  <li>\\(\text{PPP}_{O} =\\) Points Scored Per Possession on Offense</li>
  <li>\\(\text{PPP}_{D} =\\) Points Allowed Per Possession on Defense</li>
  <li>\\(\text{PPP}_{NCAA} =\\) NCAA Average Points Per Possession</li>
  <li>\\(\text{eFGO}_{NCAA} =\\) The NCAA average eFG %</li>
  <li>\\(\text{OAdjOE} =\\) Opponent's Adjusted Offensive Efficiency</li>
  <li>\\(\text{OAdjDE} =\\) Opponent's Adjusted Defensive Efficiency</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> Once averaged out for all games a team plays the adjusted offensive and defensive efficiencies are given by \\(\text{AdjOE}\\) and \\(\text{AdjDE}\\) </div>

&nbsp;

<h4>Expected Points Scored</h4>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> From these logical equations we need to take a step back and look at the overall binomial distribution. We want to model the expected number of points team A will score against team B and the variance of this score. The expected number of points team A will score per possession against team B is given by: </div>

&nbsp;

<div align="center"> $$\text{E(points)}_A = \frac{\text{AdjOE}_A \cdot \text{AdjDE}_B \cdot \text{E(Tempo)}_{A,B}}{\text{AdjDE}_{\text{NCAA}}} \cdot \frac{1}{100}$$ </div>

where:

<ul>
  <li>\\(\text{AdjOE}_A =\\) Adjusted Offensive Efficiency of team A</li>
  <li>\\(\text{AdjDE}_B =\\) Adjusted Defensive Efficiency of team B</li>
  <li>\\(\text{E(Tempo)}_{A,B} =\\) The expected number of possessions that team and A and B will each have</li>
  <li>\\(\text{AdjDE}_{\text{NCAA}} =\\) Adjusted Defensive Efficiency of the average NCAA Division 1 team</li>
  <li>Note \\(E(Tempo)_{A,B}\\) is divided by 100 because tempo is generally expressed as points per 100 possessions, therefore we divide by 100 to find points per single possession.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<h4> Variance of Points Scored</h4>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> The variance of this expectation is given in the formula for the variance of a binomial distribution. That is: </div>

&nbsp;

<div align="center"> $$\sigma^2 = np(1-p)$$</div>

where:

<ul>
  <li>\\(n =\\) The number of trials (Field Goals Attempted)</li>
  <li>\\(p =\\) The probability of success (Effective Field Goal Percentage)</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> Now we just need to plugin the expressions we determined above into this variance formula. The variance of the points scored by team A against team B is given by: </div>

&nbsp;

<div align="center"> $$\text{Var}(\text{points}_A) = E(\text{FGA}_A) \cdot E(\text{eFGO}_A)(1- \text{eFGO}_A) \cdot 2$$ </div>

where:

<ul>
  <li>\\(E(\text{FGA}_A) =\\) The expected FGA of team A against team B</li>
  <li>\\(E(\text{eFGO}_A) =\\) The expected eFG % team A will have against team B</li>
  <li>Note: Since eFG adjusts for 3-pointers we need to multiply by 2 because one “basket” is considered to be worth 2 points</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<h4> Home Court Advantage </h4>

<center>

<img src="Cameron-Crazies.jpeg" alt="Cameron Crazies" width="50%" class="center">

</center>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> Home-court advantage surely does exist and KenPom has a <a hfref="https://kenpom.com/blog/mining-point-spread-data-home-court-advantage/">great article</a> on it if you want to read more about the numbers behind it. For many years both Bart Torvik and KenPom used a multiplier of 1.4% for this advantage. This multiplier was applied to both the home and away teams’ Adjusted Offensive and Defensive Efficiencies. The home team would receive a benefit of 1.4% so their Adjusted Offensive Efficiency would be multiplied by 1.4 and their Adjusted Defensive Efficiency would be multiplied by 98.6% (100%−1.4%) (since a lower Adjusted Defensive Efficiency is better). The reverse is true for the visiting team, their Adjusted Offensive Efficiency would be multiplied by 98.6% (100%−1.4%) and their Adjusted Defensive Efficiency would be multiplied by 1.4%. Of course many games are also played on neutral courts, most notably the National Championship Tournament. Therefore no multiplier is applied to teams playing a game on a neutral court. </div>

&nbsp;

<h4> COVID and Home Court Advantage </h4>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> For the entire 2020-2021 season there were either no fans in attendance or a severely restricted amount. Fans surely have an impact on the multiplier for home court advantage. Therefore without them the multiplier has to be lower. The multiplier in this model has been set to 1% to account for this change. While this change was implemented for the 2020-2021 season it has performed reasonably well as fans have been permitted back into arenas at full capacity. </div>

&nbsp;

<h4> Simulation </h4>

<div style="text-align:justify;"> Once efficiencies have been adjusted for home court advantage we calculate the mean and variance of the binomial distribution for the points team A will score against team B. We can do the exact same thing for team B against team A. We now have two unique binomial distributions, one for team A and one for team B. Thus, we can get the probability of a random point on distribution A being higher than a random point on distribution B. This is the probability that team A beats team B. In a similar way we can see what the expected point spread is by taking the difference between \\(E(\text{points}_A)\\) and \\(E(\text{points}_B)\\). Finally a game can be simulated by sampling a random point on the distribution for team A and a random point on the distribution for team B. </div>
